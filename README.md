Hey, I'm Kot! I'm a comp sci student at the [University of Wisconsin](https://wisc.edu).

I've made a variety of software and hardware projects, from [object storage proxies](https://github.com/kotx/render) to [microcontrollers for motion controls](https://github.com/kotx/laplace)!
Here's a non-exhaustive list:

- [render](https://github.com/kotx/render), a spec-compliant Cloudflare Worker to serve objects from a Cloudflare R2 storage bucket.
- [aster](https://github.com/kotx/aster), another Cloudflare Worker that allows you to reliably upload objects to Cloudflare R2.
- [laplace](https://github.com/kotx/laplace), a program to use a Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller for Cemuhook-compatible motion controls!
- [shovel](https://github.com/kotx/shovel), a client for placing lots of pixels on [Place IPv6](https://v6.sys42.net/).
- [march](https://github.com/kotx/march), a markov chain implementation in Rust.
